ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Summer Habarneh
I'm a graduate student in Data Analytics Engineering with a strong foundation in Cognitive and Behavioral Neuroscience. My background gives me a unique perspective on human behavior and decision-making, which I now apply through the lens of data science.

This portfolio is a curated collection of projects that demonstrate my growing expertise in:

Data wrangling and analysis using Python and SQL

Machine learning and predictive modeling
